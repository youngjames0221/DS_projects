1. List the top 10 products' ProductName, ProductCode, and number of orders 
for the products with respect to number of orders, in decreasing order. This is to
examine the popularity of the models to formulate profitable business strategies.


***CODE***
SELECT DISTINCT p.productcode AS "Product Code", 
	 	    productname AS "Product Name",
       	    SUM(o.quantityordered) OVER (PARTITION BY p.productcode) AS "Order Count"	 
FROM "alanparadise/cm".products p
JOIN "alanparadise/cm".orderdetails o
ON p.productcode = o.productcode
GROUP BY 1, 2, p.productline, o.quantityordered
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. List the total number of orders within each year in descending order. By observing the yearly variance in order
quantities, we can identify change in consumers' hobbies and overall trend in their spending.


***CODE***
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT (YEAR FROM CAST(o.orderdate AS DATE)) AS "Year", 
				COUNT(o.ordernumber) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT (YEAR FROM CAST(o.orderdate AS DATE))) AS "Year total orders"
FROM "alanparadise/cm".orders o
JOIN "alanparadise/cm".orderdetails od
ON o.ordernumber = od.ordernumber
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

3. Name the top 5 products that has shown the greatest increase in profit from 2003 to 2004, 
as well as the profit amount. This allows a closer examination of people's tastes in classic models
and can further determine the effect that current pop-culture and other variables have on the industry.
